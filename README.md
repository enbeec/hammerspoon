# Val's Hammerspoon Repo

## About the Spoon directory

- Some of them are committed straight to the repo, as they haven't changed in a **long** time (Emoji was last updated 3 years ago)
- Some of them (like Zoom.spoon) are potentially move volatile so I've got them as submodules

## Installation

Clone this repo into `~/.hammerspoon` if you are not a Hammerspoon user already. Open Hammerspoon (or if it's running just make sure you can see the console) and reload the config if necessary.

__Make sure you run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to grab all dev Spoons!__
