# Val's Hammerspoon Repo

My Little Repo, My Little Repo // we all grow up some day :)

## About the Spoon directory

- Some of them are committed straight to the repo, as they haven't changed in a **long** time (Emoji was last updated 3 years ago)
- Some of them (like Zoom.spoon) are potentially move volatile so I've got them as submodules

## Installation

Make sure you run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to grab all dev Spoons!
