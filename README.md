# Val's Hammerspoon Repo

you are on the **starter config** (that may be all that's available so far)

## About the Spoon directory

- Some of them are committed straight to the repo, as they haven't changed in a **long** time (Emoji was last updated 3 years ago)
- Some of them (like Zoom.spoon) are potentially move volatile so I've got them as submodules

## Installation

Clone this repo into `~/.hammerspoon` if you are not a Hammerspoon user already. Open Hammerspoon (or if it's running just make sure you can see the console) and reload the config if necessary.

__Make sure you run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to grab all dev Spoons!__

## Getting Started

Open Hammerspoon and type `help()` into the text box at the bottom of the "Hammerspoon Console".

If you do not see the console, click the menubar item that looks like a hammer with a spoon for a handle. You will be able to open the console from that dropdown menu.

If you're just starting, I'd recommend [this tutorial on lua](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/). Take it as fast or slow as you like, despite the title. Even if you feel lost, try looking up confusing syntax in there.
